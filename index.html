		<h2>ABOUT</h2>

		<p>Nice to meet you. My name is Kat Taylor, and I am currently a senior at Eastern Washington University. I'm 21 years old, born on Noveber 1, 1992 in Seattle. I've been drawing since I could hold a writing utensil, and when I got a little older I traded the pens and pencils for a Wacom tablet and never looked back. I began my digital painting experience in Photoshop, and during my time at EWU I've also become familiar with Illustrator and InDesign.<p>

		<p>When I'm not drawing or writing, I'm listening to music, reading, or playing video games.</p>

		<h2>STUDIO ART MAJOR / VCD MINOR</h2>

		<p>Although I have an <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/cale/programs/art/art-degrees/ba-studio-art">art background in digital painting</a> first and foremost, I decided to <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/cshe/programs/design/design-degrees/minor-in-visual-communication-design">minor in VCD</a> because the art program emphasized fine art, not illustration. It took me a couple quarters to figure out what I wanted to do, but in the end I decided to continue to major in art because of my love of painting and drawing. I picked up the VCD minor to augment my abilities and I've loved every moment of it.</p>

		<p>My goal is to someday work on video games as a concept artist, an illustrator, or in the comics industry as a penciler or colorist.</p>
